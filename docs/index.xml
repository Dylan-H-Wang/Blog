      <description>Implicit conversion
Type casting
dynamic_cast
static_cast
const_cast
Implicit conversion This will automatically perform when a value is copied to a compatible type. For example:
short a = 2000; int b; b = a; The given example is also know as standard conversion
Conversions that may not be able to represent the same value   If a negative integer value is converted to an unsigned type.
E.g. unsigned char a = -1; // a = 255</description>

      <description>I will just choose directories you might use:
archetypes this is the directory contains preconfigured front matter and possibly also a content disposition for your website&#39;s content types. There are several parameters you can set.
config
This file will define the behaviour of Hugo which is related to the style of your site. If you have multiple config files, you can create a configuration directory to store them. You can choose to override the dault file with one or multiple site config files using the command line --config switch.</description>

      <description>The primary purpose of this section is that I hope you can have a basic idea about what Chinese fantasy novel is. Does it like Harry Potter which shows you an intensive and attractive wizard world? Or it likes A Song of Ice and Fire which draws the great war happening between the continents Westeros and Essos? By reading this novel, you may have a brand new view about China and be interested in taking a further study of Chinese culture, which is what precisely I want to achieve.</description>
